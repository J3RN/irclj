# irclj

Irclj is a Clojure IRC library that might remind you of Pircbot to some extent. I originally designed it to replace Pircbot in sexpbot, my Clojure IRC bot. I've already rewritten sexpbot to use the library, so it's probably the best usage example at this point.

## Usage

See testirclj.clj in src/irclj for a tiny little example bot. For a larger, real-world example, see http://www.github.com/Raynes/sexpbot

## Installation

Check the version number in project.clj, and then add irclj as a dependency in your project's project.clj, assuming you use Leiningen.
