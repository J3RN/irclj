# irclj

Irclj is currently in the middle of a complete rewrite. When it is ready for public consumption, releases will be announced on the Clojure mailing list. I'll also [tweet](http://twitter.com/IORayne) about it. Heaven knows I'll brag about it on IRC. Seriously, I might even come to you in a dream. You wont miss it.

If you're really, really interested in the old pathetic code, it's tagged 0.4.1. Have fun. Wear sunglasses.

## Usage

Don't.

## License

Licensed under the EPL, same as Clojure itself.
