# irclj

Irclj is currently in the middle of a complete rewrite. When it is ready for public consumption, releases will be announced on the Clojure mailing list. I'll also [tweet](http://twitter.com/IORayne) about it. Heaven knows I'll brag about it on IRC. Seriously, I might even come to you in a dream. You wont miss it.

## Usage

Don't.

Licensed under the EPL, same as Clojure itself.
