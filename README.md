# irclj

Irclj is a very simple and robust IRC library for Clojure. It is entirely asynchronous and callback-based.

In its current state, Irclj is a rewrite. It is WIP, but useful as it stands.

If you're really, really interested in the old pathetic code, it's tagged 0.4.1. Have fun. Wear sunglasses.
