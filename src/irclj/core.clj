;; Irclj is an IRC library for Clojure. On one hand, the goal is to make it as flexible
;; as possible and allow for any number of use cases. On the other hand, I want it to
;; be super-easy to write IRC bots with Irclj.
;;
;; Irclj takes the approach of stuffing all the information about an IRC connection
;; in a single ref that the user will hold and pass around. It also has a callback
;; system. You can register callbacks for things that happen on IRC, such as a PRIVMSG
;; or a notice.
