;; Irclj is an IRC library for Clojure. On one hand, the goal is to make it as flexible
;; as possible and allow for any number of use cases. On the other hand, I want it to
;; be super-easy to write IRC bots with Irclj.
;;
;; Irclj takes the approach of stuffing all the information about an IRC connection
;; in a single ref that the user will hold and pass around.
;;
;; Irclj is also entirely asynchronous. Everything is based on events. You can register
;; callbacks for things that happen on IRC, such as a PRIVMSG or a NOTICE. Things that
;; you might expect to return info doesn't actually return anything. Most of Irclj's
;; functions return immediately, since all they do is sent a message to IRC. The info
;; is collected later when IRC sends the requested info to the client. It might not be
;; entirely clear how to get certain information, but you can almost always collect
;; the info you want just by registering a callback that handles the data.

;; ## IRC Commands

;; The IRC spec requires that servers allow for a join command to
;; join several channels at once. We're doing some fun stuff to make
;; sure that the keyed channels come first. They have to come first
;; because if you were to try something like so:
;; `JOIN keyedchan,nonkeyed,anotherkeyedchan key,key2`
;; then IRC would think that key2 is for nonkeyed and not for
;; anotherkeyedchan.
